## Method 1: Remove Password from RAR/WinRAR Files by WinRAR Itself
 
If you still remember the password of your RAR file, you can easily remove it by using WinRAR itself. Here are the steps:
 
1. Open the password-protected RAR archive in WinRAR and click the "Extract to" option in the menu bar.
2. Select the location of the RAR where the password will be deleted.
3. Type the password for the RAR and click OK.
4. You can check the RAR file without entering the password.

You can also re-set the RAR password in WinRAR by following these steps:

1. Open WinRAR, select the RAR file with password protection, and then click the "Add" button in the upper left corner.
2. Under a pop-up window called "Archive name and parameters", select "Advanced" and click "Set password".
3. Enter the new password twice under "Enter password" and "Reenter password for verification", then click "OK".

## Method 2: Remove Password from RAR/WinRAR Files Using Notepad
 
If you don't remember the password of your RAR file, you can try to remove it using Notepad. This method is based on modifying some hexadecimal codes in the RAR file. However, it may not work for all RAR files. Here are the steps:

1. Right-click on the encrypted RAR file and open it in Notepad.
2. Search for ÃtÃ \u0090 in this file, and replace it with 53tÃ \u0090.
3. Similarly, replace 'IÅ¾C0 with \u0090IÅ¾C0.
4. Click the "Save" button in the menu bar.
5. Now you can access the RAR file without password.

## Method 3: Remove Password from RAR/WinRAR Files with CMD
 
This method is based on using a free Windows command prompt tool called cRARk to find the password of an encrypted RAR file. This tool can crack RAR passwords using brute force, which means trying all possible combinations until finding the right one. However, this method may take a long time depending on the length and complexity of the password. Here are the steps:

1. Download cRARk for Windows from [https://www.crark.net/#download](https://www.crark.net/#download).
2. Extract the files from the RAR package using WinRAR or your preferred RAR program.
3. Rename one of the language definition files to password.def. For example, if your language is English, rename english.def to password.def.
4. Open password.def in Notepad and edit it according to your preferences. For example, if you know that your password contains only lower-case letters and numbers, you can uncomment (remove #) from $a0-9 \* line.
5. Type crark yourarchivename.rar and press Enter to crack the password. Replace yourarchivename.rar with the name of the RAR file you want to crack.
6. Wait for cRARk to find your password. It may take minutes, hours, or even days depending on your GPU and password complexity.
7. Once you get your password, you can use Method 1 to remove it from your RAR file.
