The film also boasts some impressive trivia and behind-the-scenes stories that add to its appeal. For instance, did you know that a representative from the Egyptian government was on-set throughout the shoot in Cairo and Giza, to make sure that the country was not portrayed in an unflattering light[^1^]? Or that the closing credits originally announced that James Bond would return in For Your Eyes Only (1981), but due to the success of Star Wars (1977) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Moonraker (1979) was chosen instead[^1^]?
 
Another interesting fact is that the eyesight of cinematographer Claude Renoir was failing at the time of this movie, and he could not see to the end of the massive supertanker set. As a result, he could not supervise the lighting. Production designer Ken Adam turned to his friend Stanley Kubrick, who, under the condition of complete secrecy, supervised the lighting. He suggested the use of floodlights[^1^]. In addition, Kubrick's stepdaughter Katharina Kubrick designed the dentures that Richard Kiel (Jaws) wore in this movie and Moonraker (1979)[^1^].
 
One of the most iconic scenes in the film is the opening ski stunt, where Bond escapes from his enemies by skiing off a cliff and deploying a parachute with a Union Jack flag. The stunt was performed by Rick Sylvester on Asgard Peak on Baffin Island in Canada. The summit was only accessible by helicopter. A small crew, including Sylvester and second unit director John Glen, travelled there in July 1976, a month before principal photography began. They stayed in the neighboring village of Pangnirtung for ten days, awaiting the right weather conditions. Numerous cameras were positioned around the site to capture the moment[^1^].
