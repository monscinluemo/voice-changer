# Portishead - Dummy: A Trip-Hop Masterpiece
 
Dummy is the debut album by English electronic band Portishead, released in 1994.

The album opens with "Mysterons", a haunting track that sets the tone for the rest of the album. "Sour Times" is a catchy and melancholic song that became a hit single and features the famous line "Nobody loves me, it's true". "Strangers" is a groovy and funky track that samples from Weather Report. "It Could Be Sweet" is a slow and sensual song that showcases the vocals of Beth Gibbons. "Wandering Star" is a hypnotic and ethereal track that contains a sample from War. "Numb" is a minimalist and eerie song that creates a sense of isolation. "Roads" is a beautiful and emotional ballad that builds up to a powerful climax. "Pedestal" is a jazzy and upbeat track that contrasts with the lyrics about betrayal.

Dummy is a timeless and groundbreaking album that has influenced many artists across different genres. It is an essential listen for anyone who appreciates innovative and original music.

After the success of Dummy, Portishead took a three-year break before releasing their second album, simply titled Portishead, in 1997. The album was a departure from the sound of Dummy, featuring more experimental and abrasive elements, such as distorted guitars, industrial noises and orchestral arrangements. The album was also darker and more paranoid in tone, reflecting the band's dissatisfaction with fame and the music industry. Portishead received critical acclaim and reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and number 21 on the US Billboard 200. It spawned two singles, "All Mine" and "Over".
 
The album opens with "Cowboys", a menacing and chaotic track that sets the mood for the rest of the album. "All Mine" is a bombastic and cinematic song that features a brass section and a sample from Lalo Schifrin. "Undenied" is a slow and haunting track that showcases Gibbons' vocals. "Half Day Closing" is a trippy and psychedelic track that features a distorted guitar riff. "Over" is a tense and dramatic track that builds up to a noisy climax. "Humming" is a hypnotic and atmospheric track that samples from Henry Mancini. "Mourning Air" is a melancholic and melodic track that features a string section. "Seven Months" is a groovy and funky track that features a wah-wah guitar. "Only You" is a beautiful and emotional track that features a sample from Ken Thorne. "Elysium" is a somber and eerie track that features a choir and a harp. The album closes with "Western Eyes", a jazzy and mellow track that features a piano and a trumpet.
