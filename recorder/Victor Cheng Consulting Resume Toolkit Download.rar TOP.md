If you want to land a job in management consulting, you need a resume that stands out from the crowd. A consulting resume is different from a regular resume in several ways. It needs to showcase your skills, achievements, and fit for the consulting role. It also needs to pass the screening process of recruiters and consultants who review hundreds of resumes every day.
